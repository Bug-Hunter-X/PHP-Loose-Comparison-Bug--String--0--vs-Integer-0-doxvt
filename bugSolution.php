The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks for both value and type equality.  This prevents unexpected results arising from PHP's type juggling behavior. 
```php
<?php
$stringZero = '0';
$intZero = 0;

if ($stringZero === $intZero) {
  echo "String '0' is strictly equal to integer 0 (Incorrect)";
} else {
  echo "String '0' is NOT strictly equal to integer 0 (Correct)";
}
?>
```
